TITTLE: DETERMINING THE LOWEST-RISK AIRCRAFT FOR NEW BUSINESS VENTURES

Objective:Identify High-Risk and Low-Risk Aircraft Categories
          Understand Key Factors Contributing to Aircraft Accidents
          Provide Data-Driven Recommendations for Business Investment
          
Project Overview:
This project analyzes historical aircraft accident data to determine which aircraft types pose the lowest investment risk. 
By leveraging data analysis techniques, we aim to provide actionable insights for businesses looking to invest in aviation.
