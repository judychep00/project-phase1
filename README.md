TITTLE: DETERMINING THE LOWEST-RISK AIRCRAFT FOR NEW BUSINESS VENTURES

Objective:Identify High-Risk and Low-Risk Aircraft Categories
          Understand Key Factors Contributing to Aircraft Accidents
          Provide Data-Driven Recommendations for Business Investment
          
Project Overview:
This project analyzes historical aircraft accident data to determine which aircraft types pose the lowest investment risk. 
By leveraging data analysis techniques, we aim to provide actionable insights for businesses looking to invest in aviation.

Business Understanding. This helps us understand whom we are mainly dealing with in this analysis.They include:
Stakeholders:Aviation Business Investors
             Airline Operators
             Regulatory Authorities
             Safety Analysts

Key Business Questions:Which aircrafts are the most appropriater ones for them to investment in?
                        What are the key factors that mainly contribute to aircraft accidents?
                        How can businesses minimize aviation-related risks?
                        
Data Sources: Aviation Data
              USState_code

Description of Data:Aircraft model, type, and age
                    Accident severity levels eg:total fatal injuries, total uninjured etc
                    Engine types and failure rates
                    Flight phase at the time of the accident
                    Weather condition during the flights
              
Tools & Technologies Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
                           Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization
                           PowerPoint for summarizing key findings
                           GitHub for version control and project documentation
                           
Methodology:Data reading and  Cleaning-Extracted data from the aviation data , then later cleaned and preprocessed data for analysis.
            Risk Analysis Using Historical Data-Identified trends in aircraft accident rates and also did some Comparison in  accident frequencies across aircraft categories
            Visualization of Findings-Used different graphs to generate different insigshts as you will see in the powerpoint and tableu link.
            Business Recommendations- through the findings that i got i gave data-driven advice on the safest investment choices.
            
Visualizations:
Accident Severity by Aircraft Model- Shows accident severity across different aircraft types.
Phases of Flight Where Accidents Occur - Highlights accident distribution across takeoff, cruising, and landing phases.
Accidents by Engine Type  - Compares accident rates for different engine types.
            
Results & Insights:
High-Risk Aircraft Categories: Older aircraft models and small private planes have higher accident rates.
Key Factors in Accidents: Human error, maintenance issues, and engine failures are leading causes.
Investment Recommendations: Focus on modern aircraft with advanced safety features and robust maintenance programs.
